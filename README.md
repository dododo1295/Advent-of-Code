# Advent of Code

## The gist of the matter.
the whole point of this repo is to put any work I've done on Advent of Code into a single location. I started 2024 in go and decided that while I was learning a lot, it's more beneficial for me to look at doing it in something I'm more familiar with... JavaScript (ugh).
### how it's going
I need a lot of assistance whether that be looking at solutions or youtube it's helped a lot (particularly in ugly regexes).

**12/15**
I still have to look at youtube for the JS side of things but I'm beginning to feel more confident, now I can conceptualize the task and figure out the basic structure of how it needs to be done, but definitely need more assistance actually writing the code as it requires things I haven't learned yet... this is so much fun!
